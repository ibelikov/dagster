# Validating Pandas DataFrames with Dagster Types

Dagster is designed to interoperate easily with other components of your stack. In this guide we'll illustrate a technique for integrating third-party data validation libraries into your Dagster jobs: the [Dagster Type](/concepts/types) factory pattern.

Dagster types are used to perform arbitrary runtime validation on data as it flows between ops. Often you'll want to write one-off types for your domain objects. However, we can also use a factory to generate types for entire categories of objects. Here we'll see how a small factory function allows us to integrate rich validation of arbitrary Pandas dateframes into our jobs.

We'll outsource the validation logic to a purpose-built library: [Pandera](https://github.com/pandera-dev/pandera). Pandera provides an expressive API for defining dataframe schemas. Schemas encode data type, boundary, nullability, and other constraints on dataframes. The workhorse method of Pandera is `schema.validate(dataframe)`. If a dataframe violates the schema contraints, this method throws an error containing a detailed record of constraint violations.

Below, we'll see how to use a factory to wrap any Pandera schema in a Dagster type. The resulting types can then be bound to individual inputs and outputs in a job. This integrates Pandera's powerful validation capabilities with Dagster's boilerplate-free runtime type checking.

## Setup

Suppose we are a data scientist working for an e-bike rental company. We've been tasked with setting up some pipelines to analyze trip data, and have been experimenting with implementing them in Dagster. We're currently looking at the distribution of trip lengths, so we've exported a slice of trips from October into a simple <CodeReferenceLink filePath="examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/validating_pandas_dataframes_with_dagster_types/ebike_trips.csv" format="inline">CSV file</CodeReferenceLink> with 3 columns: `bike_id`, `start_time`, `end_time`.

     bike_id            start_time              end_time
           9   2021-10-20 10:39:00   2021-10-20 12:29:00
           9   2021-10-14 00:15:00   2021-10-14 00:33:00
           5   2021-10-02 12:57:00   2021-10-02 13:23:00
           1   2021-10-28 00:01:00   2021-10-28 00:34:00
           8   2021-10-23 14:22:00   2021-10-23 15:26:00
    ...

The first thing we want is to visualize the distribution of trip lengths. We set up a simple Dagster job with two ops: `load_trips` reads a CSV with our data, and `generate_plot` generates a plot of the distribution using the [MatplotLib](https://matplotlib.org/) plotting library.

```python file=/guides/validating_pandas_dataframes_with_dagster_types/job_1.py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from dagster import AssetMaterialization, job, op


@op
def load_trips():
    return pd.read_csv(
        "./2021-10_ebike_trips.csv",
        parse_dates=["start_time", "end_time"],
    )


@op
def generate_plots(trips):
    minute_lengths = [x.total_seconds() / 60 for x in trips.end_time - trips.start_time]
    bin_edges = np.histogram_bin_edges(minute_lengths, 15)
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 5))
    ax.set(title="Trip lengths", xlabel="Minutes", ylabel="Count")
    ax.hist(minute_lengths, bins=bin_edges)
    fig.savefig("trip_lengths.png")
    yield AssetMaterialization(
        asset_key="trip_dist_plot", description="Distribution of trip lengths."
    )
    yield Output(None)


@job
def generate_trip_plots():
    generate_plots(load_trips())
```

If we try running this job, our `np.histogram` call in `generate_plots` throws an error:

    # => ...
    # => ValueError: autodetected range of [nan, nan] is not finite

## Validating dataframes with Pandera

Since our code looks OK, the problem likely originates from the data. To investigate, we write a [Pandera schema](https://pandera.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dataframe_schemas.html) and try to validate our data. Our schema is, like our dataset, very simple. It asserts column data type and existence. Pandera columns are non-nullable by default, so there is also an implicit assertion that all values are defined (NOTE: this illustrates only a small slice of Pandera's functionality):

```python file=/guides/validating_pandas_dataframes_with_dagster_types/schema.py
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import pandera as pa

MIN_DATE = pd.Timestamp("2021-10-01")

df = pd.read_csv(
    "./2021-10_ebike_trips.csv",
    parse_dates=["start_time", "end_time"],
)

schema = pa.DataFrameSchema(
    columns={
        "bike_id": pa.Column(int, checks=pa.Check.ge(0)),  # ge: greater than or equal to
        "start_time": pa.Column(pd.Timestamp, checks=pa.Check.ge(MIN_DATE)),
        "end_time": pa.Column(pd.Timestamp, checks=pa.Check.ge(MIN_DATE)),
    },
)

schema.validate(df)
# => SchemaError: non-nullable series 'end_time' contains null values:
# => 22   NaT
# => 43   NaT
```

Our call to `schema.validate` has found the culprit. Somehow, null values have crept into our `end_time` column-- maybe some customers never returned their bikes...

## Dagster type factory

We are now facing a common situation in data science-- dirty data. This can cause puzzling bugs if the data travels a significant distance in a pipeline before causing a problem. In our example, it triggered an obtuse numpy error.

We can prevent these situations by validating our data before passing it downstream. There are several ways to solve this problem in Dagster. We could inline the schema and validation call in our `load_trips` op. Alternatively, we could break validation into a dedicated op that sits in between `load_trips` and any downstream computations. However, both of these approaches complicate our logic at either the graph or single op level. If this validation strategy were scaled up across all present and future analysis jobs, it could quickly become a headache.

[Dagster Types](/concepts/dagster-types) offer a more robust and elegant solution. Every op input and output can have a Dagster type that encapsulates runtime validation checks. Dagster automatically runs these checks during job execution. So if we can wrap our trip dataframe schema in a Dagster type, then we won't need to further complicate our graphs or individual ops with explicit validation calls and error handling-- Dagster's machinery will take care of this for us.

Fortunately, it's easy to write a factory function that will wrap any Pandera schema in a unique Dagster type:

```python file=/guides/validating_pandas_dataframes_with_dagster_types/factory.py
import pandas as pd
import pandera as pa
from dagster import DagsterType, TypeCheck


def pandera_schema_to_dagster_type(schema, name, description):
    def type_check_fn(_context, value):
        if not isinstance(value, pd.DataFrame):
            return TypeCheck(
                success=False,
                description=f"Must be pandas.DataFrame, not {type(value).__name__}.",
            )
        try:
            # `lazy` instructs pandera to capture every (not just the first) validation error
            schema.validate(value, lazy=True)
        except pa.errors.SchemaErrors as e:
            return TypeCheck(
                success=False,
                description=str(e),
                metadata={
                    "num_violations": len(e.failure_cases),
                },
            )

        return TypeCheck(success=True)

    return DagsterType(
        type_check_fn=type_check_fn,
        name=name,
        description=description,
    )
```

Let's unpack the above code. Our factory function is `pandera_schema_to_dagster_type`. It's purpose is to construct a custom type check function (`type_check_fn`) and corresponding `DagsterType`.

Inside `type_check_fn`, we let `pandera` do the heavy lifting. After confirming `value` is in fact a `DataFrame`, we call `schema.validate` and tack the message of any resulting `SchemaErrors` instance onto our returned `TypeCheck` instance. `TypeCheck` is an optional rich return type for Dagster type check functions (it is also possible to return a boolean indicating a simple pass/fail). A `TypeCheck` is appropriate here because we want to capture specific information about any validation failures.

Notice also that we provide a `metadata` dictionary to the `TypeCheck` constructor when validation fails. This can hold arbitrary information that is visible in [Dagit](/concepts/dagit) and can be useful in debugging. Here we've only provided a count `num_violations` of the schema violations (`SchemaErrors.failure_cases` is a dataframe tabulating each violation), but we could easily include richer information to annotate more complex validations.

## Annotate our job with Dagster types

Now that we can turn Pandera schemas into Dagster types, we only need to tweak our job definition a little bit to integrate Pandera validation.

```python file=/guides/validating_pandas_dataframes_with_dagster_types/job_2.py endbefore=execution
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import pandera as pa
from dagster import AssetMaterialization, In, Out, job, op

from .factory import pandera_schema_to_dagster_type

MIN_DATE = pd.Timestamp("2021-10-01")

schema = pa.DataFrameSchema(
    columns={
        "bike_id": pa.Column(int, checks=pa.Check.ge(0)),  # ge: greater than or equal to
        "start_time": pa.Column(pd.Timestamp, checks=pa.Check.ge(MIN_DATE)),
        "end_time": pa.Column(pd.Timestamp, checks=pa.Check.ge(MIN_DATE)),
    },
)

# This is a Dagster type that wraps the schema
TripsDataFrame = pandera_schema_to_dagster_type(
    schema, "TripsDataFrame", "DataFrame type for e-bike trips."
)


# We've added a Dagster type for this op's output
@op(out=Out(TripsDataFrame), config_schema={"clean": bool})
def load_trips(context):
    df = pd.read_csv(
        "./ebike_trips.csv",
        parse_dates=["start_time", "end_time"],
    )
    if context.op_config["clean"]:
        df = df[pd.notna(df.end_time)]
    return df


# We've added a Dagster type for this op's input
@op(ins={"trips": In(TripsDataFrame)})
def generate_plots(trips):
    minute_lengths = [x.total_seconds() / 60 for x in trips.end_time - trips.start_time]
    bin_edges = np.histogram_bin_edges(minute_lengths, 15)
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 5))
    ax.set(title="Trip lengths", xlabel="Minutes", ylabel="Count")
    ax.hist(minute_lengths, bins=bin_edges)
    fig.savefig("trip_lengths.png")
    yield AssetMaterialization(
        asset_key="trip_dist_plot", description="Distribution of trip lengths."
    )
    yield Output(None)


@job
def generate_trip_plots():
    generate_plots(load_trips())
```

The above job definition makes two modifications to the previous one. First, we've added `ins`/`out` arguments to the `op` decorators. We specify that `load_trips` must return a `TripsDataFrame` as output, and `generate_plots` must take a `TripsDataFrame` as input. Now when we execute the `generate_trip_plots` job, Dagster will automatically apply the `TripsDataFrame` validation to our dataframe before it enters `generate_plots`, and terminate execution if the validation fails.

Second, we've added a `clean` configuration parameter to `load_trips`. When `clean` is true, `load_trips` strips out records with missing end dates before outputting a dataframe.

Let's see what happens when we run without setting `clean`:

```python file=/guides/validating_pandas_dataframes_with_dagster_types/job_2.py startafter=execution_1 endbefore=execution_2
generate_trip_plots.execute_in_process()
# => ...
# => dagster.core.errors.DagsterTypeCheckDidNotPass: Type check failed for step output "result" - expected type "TripsDataFrame".
# => ...
```

Now let's try with `clean` set. Stripping out the offeniing records should allow our dataframe to pass the `TripsDataframe` validation:

```python file=/guides/validating_pandas_dataframes_with_dagster_types/job_2.py startafter=execution_2
generate_trip_plots.execute_in_process(
    run_config={"ops": {"load_trips": {"config": {"clean": True}}}}
)
# => ...
# => 2021-11-11 19:54:26 - dagster - DEBUG - generate_trip_plots - 3e00e9e3-27f3-490e-b1bd-ec17b92e5599 - 28168 - RUN_SUCCESS - Finished execution of run for "generate_trip_plots".
```

Success! We also find that our histogram was successfully rendered to `./trip_lengths.png`.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we saw how to smoothly integrate a third-party data validation library with Dagster. This can imbue our jobs with powerful runtime data validation while requiring little extra code.

We used [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Pandera](https://pandera.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as an example, but the same technique can be used for any kind of data validation service. The basic pattern is to wrap validation entities in [Dagster Types](/concepts/dagster-types). Use of a factory function achieves this with a minimum of code. Inside the factory, you are free to translate validation results into `TypeCheck` objects however you like. You can keep it simple, like we did here, or provide custom detailed validation metadata for inspection in Dagit.
